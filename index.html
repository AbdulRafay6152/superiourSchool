        <summary>OUR TEACHER'S EXPERTIES</summary>
        <summary><B>SIR SOHAIL LAKHO</B></summary>
        <p>He is our principal — a calm storm of wisdom who walks the halls like they’re holding their breath for him. A
            leader with a steady heart, lifting us with guidance that feels gentle yet powerful. His presence inspires,
            his words settle like soft light, and his dedication shapes our future with quiet grace. </p>
        <summary><b>SIR FAHEEM ASLAM</b></summary>
        <p>He is the manager of our school and a teacher of computer science — a rare blend of sharp logic and soft
            leadership. He runs the place with calm precision, like someone who sees the bigger picture even when the
            rest of us don’t. His guidance feels steady, his decisions thoughtful, and when he teaches, it’s like he
            opens a doorway into the digital universe. Students trust his vibe, staff rely on his clarity, and the whole
            school moves smoother because of his quiet, brilliant presence.</p>
        <summary><b>SIR YOUSUF GOHRI</b></summary>
        <p>He is our maths teacher, gifted with a memory so sharp it feels almost unreal — like he carries whole
            formulas, concepts, and patterns in his back pocket. He explains numbers with a calm rhythm, turning tough
            problems into something soft and approachable. His confidence lifts us, his patience grounds us, and his
            brilliance quietly inspires everyone around him.</p>
        <summary><b>SIR AYAZ</b></summary>
        <p>He is our physics teacher, but honestly, he feels more like a big brother — someone who breaks down tough
            concepts with this effortless charm that makes everything click. He explains topics briefly yet amazingly,
            turning heavy theories into light-bulb moments. With him, learning feels less like pressure and more like a
            quiet adventure through the universe.</p>
        <summary><b>SIR SHUJAT AHMED</b></summary>
        <P>He is our English teacher, an absolute expert in the language — the kind of person who makes words feel
            alive, like they’re dancing in the air. His teaching skills are genuinely amazing, smooth and effortless,
            turning grammar into something graceful and stories into something you can almost touch. He guides us with
            patience, lifts us with clarity, and leaves us feeling a little brighter, a little wiser, every single day.
